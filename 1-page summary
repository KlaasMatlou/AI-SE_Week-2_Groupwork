 AI for Sustainable Agriculture

Project Title: Predicting Crop Failure using Machine Learning
SDG Focus: Goal 2 – Zero Hunger


---

 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict potential crop failure based on environmental conditions such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The goal is to help farmers and policymakers take preventive action to reduce crop loss and support food security.

 Dataset Overview

Source: Crop_recommendation.csv

Features Used:

Soil Nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K)

Environmental: Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Rainfall (mm), pH level


Target (Simulated):

Crop failure (1) vs. No failure (0)

Failure defined by low rainfall (< 60 mm), low pH (< 5.5), or low humidity (< 45%)




---

 Methodology

Preprocessing: Data normalized using StandardScaler

Model: RandomForestClassifier

Training/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib



---

 Results

Accuracy: 100%

Precision, Recall, F1-Score: 100%

Confusion Matrix: Showed perfect classification

Overfitting: None detected – both training and test performance were equal



---

 Impact

This model can be integrated into agritech tools to alert farmers about unfavorable conditions in advance, allowing for timely interventions (e.g., irrigation, fertilization, or crop switching), supporting food production and minimizing waste.

Future Directions

To Use real-world crop yield and failure datasets

To Include location-based and satellite data

 To Deploy as a mobile or web-based advisory tool for farmers
