Project Title: Predicting Crop Failure using Machine Learning
SDG Focus: Goal 2 – Zero Hunger


---

 Objective

To build a machine learning model that can predict potential crop failure based on environmental conditions such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. The goal is to help farmers and policymakers take preventive action to reduce crop loss and support food security.

 Dataset Overview

Source: Crop_recommendation.csv

Features Used:

Soil Nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K)

Environmental: Temperature (°C), Humidity (%), Rainfall (mm), pH level


Target (Simulated):

Crop failure (1) vs. No failure (0)

Failure defined by low rainfall (< 60 mm), low pH (< 5.5), or low humidity (< 45%)

### Methodology

The project involved the following steps:

1.  **Data Preparation:**
    *   Loading the dataset and creating the synthetic 'failure' target variable.
    *   Separating features and the target.
    *   Normalizing features using `StandardScaler`.
    *   Splitting data into 80% for training and 20% for testing.

2.  **Initial Model Exploration (Random Forest):**
    *   An initial model was built using `RandomForestClassifier` with default parameters.
    *   This model achieved seemingly perfect metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score = 1.00) on both training and test datasets.

3.  **Identifying Overfitting:**
    *   While the perfect scores on the test set were initially promising, achieving 100% accuracy on a test set is often a strong indicator of **overfitting**, especially with a powerful model like Random Forest on a potentially simple, synthetically labeled dataset.

4.  **Refined Approach with Logistic Regression:**
    *   To address the overfitting concern and build a more robust model, we shifted our focus to `LogisticRegression`, a simpler and more interpretable algorithm.
    *   We implemented a systematic approach to optimize the Logistic Regression model.

5.  **Hyperparameter Tuning and Cross-Validation (Logistic Regression):**
    *   We used `GridSearchCV` with 5-fold cross-validation on the training data to find the optimal regularization parameter, `C`.
    *   An expanded range of `C` values was explored: `[0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100, 500, 1000]`.
    *   The tuning process aimed to maximize the **F1-score**, balancing precision and recall, while using cross-validation to ensure the performance was consistent across different data subsets.

6.  Training/Test Split: 80% training, 20% testing

7.  Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib

### Results

*   **Initial Random Forest Model:**
    *   Accuracy: 1.00 (Training and Test)
    *   Metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-Score = 1.00
    *   **Conclusion:** Evidence suggested **severe overfitting**.

*   **Tuned Logistic Regression Model (Optimal C=10 found via Grid Search):**
    *   Best Cross-Validation F1-score: ~0.84
    *   Performance on Training Data:
        *   Accuracy: 0.88
        *   Precision: 0.83
        *   Recall: 0.86
        *   F1-Score: 0.85
    *   Performance on Independent Test Data:
        *   Accuracy: 0.87
        *   Precision: 0.80
        *   Recall: 0.83
        *   F1-Score: 0.81
    *   **Conclusion:** The close proximity of training, test, and cross-validation metrics indicates that **severe overfitting has been addressed**. The tuned Logistic Regression model demonstrates good generalization ability.

 Impact

This model can be integrated into agritech tools to alert farmers about unfavorable conditions in advance, allowing for timely interventions (e.g., irrigation, fertilization, or crop switching), supporting food production and minimizing waste.
